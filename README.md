Vine Reactions
==============
Display a Vine video and people's recorded reactions to that video.

A concept conceived at a two-hour hackathon called [Protonight](http://protonight.com/) with [Daniel Conway](www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-j-conway/1b/510/4a5).

How far we got
--------------
* Index page with all of the indexed vines
* Show page with embed vine
* Access to User's webcam with HTML5's getUserMedia
* Display's user's webcam input on Vine's show page

Ideas
-----
* Setup recording of webcam
* Video is not autoplay
* Once play button is press, the video plays and webcam reaction is recorded
* Upload recording to server
* Convert recording to gif
* Display all of the vine's reactions around the embedded vine video
* Authenitication
* Comments
